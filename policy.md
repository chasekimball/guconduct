## I. Introduction

In recognition of Georgetown University’s commitment to provide a safe
and hospitable environment for all members of our community to work and
study, the University prohibits sexual misconduct that constitutes
sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking, and
related claims of retaliation. Sexual misconduct subverts the
University's mission, diminishes the dignity of both Complainant and
Respondent, and threatens permanent damage to the careers, educational
experience, and well-being of our students, faculty and staff. Sexual
harassment is a form of sex discrimination and is prohibited by
University policy, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title
VII”), Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”), and
the District of Columbia Human Rights Act. Sexual assault, relationship
violence and stalking are also forms of sexual misconduct, and are
prohibited by law and this policy.

The Sexual Misconduct Policies and Procedures are a supplement to the
Code of Student Conduct and the Standard Hearing Policies and
Procedures. They are designed to provide for prompt, thorough, and
equitable investigation and resolution of complaints that involve
allegations of sexual misconduct filed against University students
through the student conduct system. The University will conduct a
reliable and impartial investigation of sexual misconduct complaints to
determine the relevant facts from which a well-informed decision can be
made and an appropriate resolution reached. The Georgetown University
student conduct procedures are conducted by officials who receive annual
and ongoing training on, among other things, the University’s policies
and procedures, how to conduct a fair and equitable adjudication, and
the effects of trauma on parties impacted by sexual misconduct.

Both women and men may be victims of sexual misconduct. Sexual
misconduct may occur between persons of the same or opposite sex. The
student conduct system is designed to fit within the University’s larger
education system and does not function as a court of law. As such, the
Office of Student Conduct utilizes language that is designed to be both
educationally-focused and procedurally neutral when describing its
policies and procedures. Additionally, procedural issues, including the
introduction and consideration of information, are handled in a manner
consistent with the University’s educational focus. The student conduct
system is not a substitute for the criminal and civil courts, but it is
an additional option for Complainants to resolve their complaint when
the Respondent is a Georgetown University student.

## II. Definitions

The following selected terms are defined in an effort to facilitate a
better understanding of the Office of Student Conduct’s Sexual
Misconduct Policies and Procedures:

1.  “Complainant” refers to an individual(s) who has filed a formal
    complaint against a Georgetown University student through the
    student conduct system. In cases when the University serves as the
    “Complainant,” this term may be used to describe both the
    University and/or the alleged Victim(s).
2.  “Director for Student Conduct” refers to the individual responsible
    for properly implementing fair conduct procedures and overseeing the
    administration of the student conduct system. The Director may
    designate any other appropriate individual to perform these duties.
3.  “Formal Complaint” refers to the written statement from an
    individual indicating their intent to pursue a complaint through the
    Georgetown University student conduct system.
4.  “Investigator” refers to an individual(s) appointed by the
    University to conduct a prompt, thorough, and equitable
    investigation into a complaint involving allegations of sexual
    misconduct. The Investigator will have specific training and
    expertise in, among other things, the University’s policies and
    procedures, how to conduct a fair and equitable investigation, and
    the effects of trauma on parties impacted by sexual misconduct.
5.  “Respondent” refers to a Georgetown student who has been alleged of
    violating the Code of Student Conduct while they were a Georgetown
    student through the Georgetown University student conduct system.
6.  “Judicial Coordinator” refers to the individual responsible for
    attending any Hearing and/or Appeals meeting to ensure that these
    procedures are conducted in an efficient and orderly fashion. The
    Judicial Coordinator may interject in cases of clear procedural
    error, as well as answer questions of the Panels regarding
    procedures. The Judicial Coordinator will not vote on any decision
    by a Sexual Misconduct Hearing and/or Appeals Committee. The
    Director may designate any appropriate individual to perform these
    duties.
7.  “Appeals Committee” refers to the standing Appeals Committee
    composed of a senior administrator from Student Affairs, a
    faculty/staff representative, and a student representative. The
    Appeals Committee is responsible for reviewing all appeals through
    the student conduct system. The Appeals Committee will have specific
    training on, among other things, the University’s policies and
    procedures, how to conduct a fair and equitable adjudication, and
    the effects of trauma on parties impacted by sexual misconduct.
8.  “Sexual Misconduct Hearing Panel” refers to a Hearing Panel
    comprised of two (2) faculty/staff members and one (1) student that
    hears cases involving allegations of sexual misconduct. At the
    written request of both the Complainant and Respondent, the Office
    of Student Conduct will substitute a faculty/staff member in place
    of the one (1) student member of the panel for Sexual Misconduct
    cases. If this request is not submitted, in writing, by both the
    Complainant and Respondent, the Hearing Panel will remain two (2)
    faculty/staff members and one (1) student. The Hearing Panel will
    have specific training on, among other things, the University’s
    policies and procedures, how to conduct a fair and equitable
    adjudication, and the effects of trauma on parties impacted by
    sexual misconduct.
9.  “Sexual Misconduct Policy” refers to the Office of Student Conduct’s
    policies on sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship
    violence, and stalking (see also: Sexual Misconduct Policy, p. 7).
10. “Sexual Misconduct Procedures” refers to the Office of Student
    Conduct’s procedures to address complaints involving allegations of
    sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship violence, and
    stalking (see also: Sexual Misconduct Procedures, p. 11).
11. “Student” refers to an individual admitted into an undergraduate,
    graduate, or School of Continuing Studies course or program at
    Georgetown University.

## III. Jurisdiction

1.  These policies and procedures apply for an individual or the
    University (“Complainant”) filing a complaint involving allegations
    of sexual misconduct against a current Georgetown University student
    (“Respondent”). These policies and procedures are applicable to
    behaviors that occur on-campus, as well as behaviors that occur
    off-campus or while studying abroad, when, in the judgement of the
    Office of Student Conduct, the alleged conduct has a negative impact
    on the University community, the pursuit of its mission, or the
    broader community in which we live.  
    1.  If a complaint involves allegations of both sexual misconduct
        and non-sexual misconduct (e.g. Sexual Misconduct and Physical
        Assault), these policies and procedures may be utilized to
        resolve all charges associated with the incident.
    2.  For cases when the University is serving at the Complainant, or
        when there are multiple Complainant(s) and/or Respondent(s)
        involved, the Director for Student Conduct may make reasonable
        alterations to these procedures, including consolidating
        multiple cases into a single case where appropriate, in the
        spirit of providing a prompt, thorough, and equitable process
        for all parties involved in the student conduct process (see
        also: Consolidated Cases, p. 7; Procedural Alterations, p. 27).
2.  These policies and procedures are not applicable for complaints
    against faculty/staff, School of Medicine students, or Law Center
    students. For more information regarding those grievance procedures,
    please visit:
    [http://sexualassault.georgetown.edu](http://sexualassault.georgetown.edu/).

<div id="multiplecomplainantsrespondents">

## IV. Multiple Complainant(s)/Respondent(s)

For cases involving **multiple Complainant(s) and/or Respondent(s)**,
the Director for Student Conduct may make reasonable alterations to
these procedures in the spirit of providing a prompt, thorough, and
equitable process for all parties involved in the student conduct
process (see also: Procedural Alterations, p. 27).

</div>

<div id="consolidatedcases">

## V. Consolidated Cases

The Office of Student Conduct may **consolidate multiple cases and/or
incidents** to resolve as a single case under the following
circumstances:

1.  The Respondent is alleged to have been involved in multiple
    incidents of sexual misconduct with the same Complainant;
2.  The Respondent is alleged to have been involved in the same
    incident(s) or closely interrelated incident(s) of sexual misconduct
    with multiple Complainants;
3.  More than one Respondent is alleged to have been involved in the
    same incident(s) or closely interrelated incident(s) of sexual
    misconduct with the same Complainant.

## VI. Sexual Misconduct Policy

Georgetown University has adopted a Policy Statement on Sexual
Misconduct in recognition of our commitment to provide a safe and
hospitable environment for all members of our community to work and
study. The Office of Student Conduct has adopted the following policies,
based on the University’s Policy Statement on Sexual Misconduct:

<span class="underline">Sexual Misconduct</span> is unwanted conduct of
a sexual nature that constitutes sexual harassment, sexual assault,
relationship violence (including domestic violence and dating violence),
or stalking, and includes related acts of retaliation.

<span class="underline">Sexual Harassment</span> is defined as any
unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, including sexual advances, request
for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual or
gender-based nature when:

1.  Submission to such conduct is made explicitly or implicitly a term
    or condition of an individual's employment or academic relationship;
    or

2.  Submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as a basis for
    making an employment or academic decision affecting an individual;
    or

3.  Such conduct has the purpose or effect of interfering with an
    individual's work or academic performance, denying or limiting an
    individual’s ability to participate in or benefit from the
    University’s education programs, or creating an intimidating,
    hostile, or offensive environment for work or academic pursuit.
    
    *An Administrator’s or Hearing Board’s use of interpretative
    guidance in determining sexual harassment in a case includes, but is
    not limited to:*
    
    1.  A hostile or offensive environment exists when conduct is severe
        or pervasive. Factors to be considered in determining whether
        conduct is severe or pervasive include the nature, scope,
        frequency, and duration of the conduct and the number of persons
        involved. Simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated
        incidents that are not severe or pervasive do not create a
        hostile or offensive environment.
    2.  If an issue of sexual harassment is raised in strictly academic
        areas, such as coursework, the matter will be handled in
        consultation and coordination between IDEAA and the Executive
        Vice President or Dean of the faculty member’s school because
        such matters may also implicate issues of academic freedom.
    3.  To constitute sexual harassment, the conduct in question must be
        objectively intimidating, hostile or offensive, and must
        interfere with a person’s ability to participate in employment
        or educational programs or activities of the University. The
        victim’s perception of the offensiveness of the alleged conduct,
        standing alone, is not sufficient by itself to constitute sexual
        harassment.
    4.  Sexual harassment is especially serious when it occurs between
        teachers and students or supervisors and subordinates. In such
        situations, sexual harassment unfairly exploits the power
        inherent in a faculty member's or supervisor's position.
        Although sexual harassment often occurs when one person takes
        advantage of a position of authority over another, the
        University recognizes that sexual harassment may also occur
        between people of equivalent status. This includes peer sexual
        harassment. Regardless of the form it may take, the University
        will not tolerate unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that
        creates an unacceptable working or educational environment.

<span class="underline">Sexual Assault</span> is a forcible or
non-forcible sexual act or sexual contact that occurs without the
consent or permission of the other person. Sexual assault is divided
into five categories, described below. Sanctions may vary depending on
the category of offense.

1.  Engaging in a sexual act with the use of force; use of threats or
    fear; after rendering the person unconscious; or by administering a
    drug, intoxicant, or other substance that substantially impairs the
    ability of the other person to appraise or control his or her
    conduct.
2.  Engaging in a sexual act where the person knows or reasonably should
    know that the other person is incapable of appraising the nature of
    the conduct; incapable of declining participation in the sexual
    conduct; incapable of communicating unwillingness to engage in the
    sexual conduct; or incapable of giving consent (such as when the
    person is incapacitated due to alcohol use).
3.  Engaging in sexual contact with another person with the use of
    force; use of threats or fear; after rendering the person
    unconscious; or by administering a drug, intoxicant, or other
    substance that substantially impairs the ability of the other person
    to appraise or control his or her conduct. 9
4.  Engaging in sexual contact where the person knows or reasonably
    should know that the other person is incapable of appraising the
    nature of the conduct; incapable of declining participation in the
    sexual conduct; incapable of communicating unwillingness to engage
    in the sexual conduct; or incapable of giving consent (such as when
    the person is incapacitated due to alcohol use).
5.  Engaging in a sexual act or sexual contact with another person with
    knowledge or reason to know that the sexual act or sexual contact
    was unwanted and committed without the person’s permission or
    consent.

**For purposes of this definition, the following terms are defined:**  

*Sexual act* is penetration, however slight, of the anus or vulva of
another by a penis; contact between the mouth and the penis, vulva, or
anus; or the penetration, however slight, of the anus or vulva by a hand
or finger or by any object. The emission of semen is not required to be
considered a sexual act.

*Sexual contact* means the touching with any clothed or unclothed body
part or any object, either directly or through the clothing, of the
genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person.

*Consent* is words or overt actions indicating a freely given agreement
to the sexual act or sexual contact in question.

*An Administrator’s or Hearing Panel’s use of interpretative guidance in
determining consent in a case includes, but is not limited to:*  

1.  The willingness to participate must be clearly indicated prior to
    any sexual act or sexual contact.
2.  If at any time during the sexual act or sexual contact any confusion
    or ambiguity should arise on the issue of consent, it is incumbent
    upon the individual to stop the activity and clarify, verbally, the
    other’s willingness to continue.
3.  A verbal “no,” even if it may sound indecisive or insincere,
    constitutes lack of consent.
4.  The absence of an overt action or an explicit verbal response to a
    verbal request for consent constitutes lack of consent.
5.  It is expected that, once consent has been established, a person who
    changes his/her mind during the sexual act or sexual contact will
    communicate through words or overt actions his/her decision to no
    longer proceed.
6.  Past consent to sexual act or sexual contact does not imply future
    ongoing consent, and the fact that two persons are in an on-going
    relationship shall not preclude the possibility that sexual
    misconduct might occur within that relationship.
7.  A person’s use of alcohol and/or other drugs shall not diminish such
    person’s responsibility to obtain consent.
8.  Lack of verbal or physical resistance, or submission by the
    unwilling participant, when such submission results from the use of
    force, threats, or coercion by the respondent shall not constitute
    consent.
9.  A person is considered incapable of giving consent if he/she is
    asleep, unconscious, and/or losing and regaining consciousness, or
    clearly mentally or physically incapacitated, for example, by
    alcohol and/or other drugs (signs of incapacitation include, but are
    not limited to, difficulty walking, inability to speak in a coherent
    manner, vomiting or the presence of vomit, etc.)

*Force* means the use or threatened use of a weapon; the use of such
physical strength or violence as is sufficient to overcome, restrain, or
injure a person; or the use of a threat of harm sufficient to coerce or
compel submission by another person.

*Forcible* is defined as any sexual act or sexual contact directed
against another person, with force and/or against that person’s will; or
without force or against the person’s will where the victim is incapable
of giving consent.

<span class="underline">Relationship Violence</span> means a violent or
threatening familial or intimate partner relationship that causes one to
fear for his/her safety or causes physical or psychological injury,
pain, or illness. Relationship violence includes, but may not be limited
to:

1.  *Dating violence*: an offense against an intimate partner (romantic,
    dating, or sexual relationship) that results in physical injury,
    including physical pain or illness or that caused or was intended to
    cause reasonable fear of imminent serious physical injury or death.

2.  *Domestic violence*: an intrafamily offense that results in physical
    injury, including physical pain or illness, or that caused or was
    intended to cause reasonable fear of imminent serious physical
    injury or death.
    
    *An Administrator’s or Hearing Panel’s use of interpretative
    guidance in determining relationship violence in a case includes,
    but is not limited to:*
    
    1.  Intimate Partner refers to individuals who share a current or
        former romantic, dating, or sexual involvement. Consideration
        should be given to the duration, nature, and frequency of
        interaction between the individuals.
    2.  Intrafamily refers to individuals who share a biological or
        legally established ancestral connection (e.g. sibling, parent,
        or spouse).
    3.  Physical or psychological injury, pain or illness should be
        given consideration for both domestic and dating violence cases.
    4.  A reasonable fear for one’s safety can result from the use of
        physical force and/or abusive behavior intended, or reasonably
        anticipated to intimidate, manipulate, humiliate, isolate, or
        coerce another into doing something against his/her will or
        self-interest. Such behavior includes, but is not limited to
        physical, verbal, sexual, emotional, technological, or financial
        forms of abuse.

<span class="underline">Stalking</span> means a course of conduct
directed at a specific individual that places that individual in
reasonable fear for his or her safety or the safety of another person;
to feel seriously alarmed, disturbed, or frightened; or suffer emotional
distress. Such behaviors or activities may include, but are not limited
to, the following:

1.  Unwelcomed communication of any type, including but not limited to
    face-to-face, telephone calls, voice messages, electronic, written
    letters or notes, unwanted gifts, etc.;
2.  Use of threatening words and/or conduct;
3.  Pursuing, following, observing, and/or surveillance.

## VII. Sexual Misconduct Procedures

Filing a Formal Complaint

In order to initiate a formal complaint, an individual (Complainant)
must submit a written statement (“Statement of Complaint”) detailing the
allegations of sexual misconduct to the Office of Student Conduct (see
also: Reporting Contact Information, p. 28). While the Statement of
Complaint is not meant to be an exhaustive account of the incident(s),
the statement must state the name or clear identifier of the Respondent
and describe with reasonable specificity any of the alleged incident(s)
that they want to be addressed by the Office of Student Conduct,
including the date and place of the incident(s). The Office of Student
Conduct reviews all Statements of Complaint to determine what policy
charges, if any, should be applied in each case.

1.  The Statement of Complaint may not exceed five (5) pages (see also:
    Written Statement Guidelines, p. 27).
2.  While prompt reporting may aid an investigation, there is no time
    limit imposed as to when a formal complaint may be initiated against
    a current student, provided they were a Georgetown University
    student at the time of the alleged incident.
3.  If a Complainant wishes to remain anonymous and/or does not wish to
    initiate a formal complaint, the University will strive to
    accommodate the Complainant’s wishes. However, due to the
    University’s commitment to provide a reasonably safe and
    non-discriminatory environment for all students, the Director for
    Student Conduct may investigate any allegations brought to their
    attention. For more information, please see: Requests for Anonymity
    and/or Non-Pursuit of a Complaint, p. 25.
4.  If an individual is unsure about whether they want to file a formal
    complaint, the individual is encouraged to contact a confidential
    counselor. Confidential counselors can help students understand what
    reporting options are available and assist with the process if they
    choose to file a formal complaint. Going to a confidential counselor
    does not foreclose the opportunity to make a report to the
    University or file a formal complaint at a later time. For more
    information, please see: Confidential Resources, p. 28.

A Complainant may also choose to file a criminal report with the
Georgetown University Police Department (“GUPD”) and/or Metropolitan
Police Department (“MPD”).

1.  a. The University student conduct system is a separate system from
    the criminal justice system. Typically, the University will not wait
    for the conclusion of a criminal investigation or criminal
    proceeding to begin its own sexual misconduct investigation. At the
    request of law enforcement authorities, however, the University may
    need to delay temporarily the fact-finding portion of a sexual
    misconduct investigation while the police gather evidence. In those
    circumstances, the University may still implement Protective
    Measures and/or additional remedies (see also: Protective Measures
    and Remedies, p. 23) to protect and support all parties and the
    University community. The University may also continue to update the
    parties on the status of the investigation and inform the parties
    when the school resumes its sexual misconduct investigation.

Responding to a Formal Complaint

The Office of Student Conduct will issue a “No Contact Order” between
the Complainant and Respondent.

The Respondent will be notified that a formal complaint has been
submitted to the Office of Student Conduct and a mandatory initial
intake meeting will be scheduled with the Office of Student Conduct to
review the sexual misconduct adjudication process.

The Respondent will be provided access to the Statement of Complaint.
They will be granted seven (7) calendar days from receipt of the
Statement of Complaint to submit his/her written response (“Statement of
Response”) to the complaint. Submission of the Statement of Response is
not mandatory.

1.  The Statement of Response may not exceed five (5) pages (see also:
    Written Statement Guidelines, p. 27).
2.  If the Respondent acknowledges responsibility for the alleged
    behaviors identified in the formal complaint in his/her Statement of
    Response, the Office of Student Conduct may resolve the incident via
    Administrative Action. For more information regarding Administrative
    Action, please refer to the Code of Student Conduct.
3.  If the Respondent fails to submit a Statement of Response and/or
    denies responsibility for the alleged behaviors identified in the
    Statement of Complaint, the Office of Student Conduct will determine
    the most appropriate method of resolution, which may include
    forwarding the Statement of Complaint and the Statement of Response
    to the Title IX Coordinator to appoint an Investigator
    (“Investigator”) to conduct a prompt, thorough, and equitable
    investigation into the complaint.
4.  The Complainant will be provided access to the Respondent's
    Statement of Response, when applicable, prior to the Complainant's
    meeting with the Investigator.

Alternative Methods of Resolution

1.  In cases that do not involve sexual assault, both parties and/or the
    Director for Student Conduct may suggest attempting to resolve the
    complaint via an alternative method of resolution, such as
    mediation, at any time during the process.
2.  The Complainant and Respondent must agree, voluntarily, to the
    alternative method of resolution. The University will never compel a
    Complainant and/or Respondent to engage in any type of alternative
    resolution and/or to directly confront the other party.
    Participation in an alternative resolution is voluntary and either
    party can request to resume the formal adjudication process.
3.  If the parties elect to participate in mediation as part of the
    alternative resolution process, facilitators will guide a dialogue
    between the parties either with both parties present, or with both
    parties separately with the goal of identifying how the harm(s)
    alleged by the Complainant can be repaired. Together or separately,
    the parties and the facilitators will create a written agreement
    that may include items such as apology letters, agreement to a no
    contact order, restriction of access, and/or education related to
    the offense. The content of the agreement is created on a casebycase
    basis, and students are supported in creating their own agreements.
    The Office of Student Conduct will monitor the parties’ adherence to
    the signed agreement and close the matter when compliance is deemed
    complete.
4.  Alternative methods of conflict resolution may never be used for
    complaints that involve sexual assault.

Investigation

The Office of Student Conduct will provide the finalized Statement of
Complaint and the Statement of Response, when applicable, to the
Investigator, Complainant, and Respondent.

The Investigator will contact the Complainant and Respondent to conduct
separate interviews with each party.

1.  Parties are expected to have their initial interview within seven
    (7) calendar days of their initial contact by the Investigator.
2.  During the interviews, the Investigator will ask the parties to
    identify possible factual witnesses related to the complaint.

The Investigator may request any additional documentation and/or
information that he/she/they deem relevant to the investigation.

In order to ensure a prompt, thorough, and equitable investigation,
parties are expected to adhere to the Investigator’s requested deadlines
for any follow up interviews and/or submission of materials.

The Investigator has the discretion to determine what information
he/she/they deem relevant to be included in the Investigative Report.

Investigative Report

Upon completing the investigation, the Investigator will compile the
Investigative Report (“Report”). Within the Report, the Investigator
will describe the relevant information learned during the investigation
and summarize all interviews conducted by the Investigator. The
Investigator may not offer any recommendations as to whether a violation
of the Code of Student Conduct occurred.

The Report will be provided to the Office of Student Conduct, who will
ensure that it follows the process’ established policies and procedures.
The Complainant and Respondent will receive access to the Report from
the Office of Student Conduct and may each submit a written response to
the Report.

1.  The written response may not exceed five (5) pages and must be
    submitted within seven (7) calendar days after receiving access to
    the Report (see also: Written Statement Guidelines, p. 27).
2.  Complainants and Respondents are not permitted to share the Report
    with any individual(s) other than their advisor and/or
    parent/guardian(s), provided the parent/guardian(s) is not serving
    as a witness (see also: Advisor/Support Person, p. 24).

The Complainant and Respondent may also submit an additional written
statement regarding the impact (“Impact Statement”) of the complaint
and/or requested remedies by two (2) calendar days before the scheduled
Hearing.

1.  The Impact Statement may not exceed five (5) pages and may not be
    included in the official Case File. The Hearing Panel may only
    consider the Impact Statement during sanctioning if a Respondent is
    found “Responsible” (see also: Sanctioning, p. 17; Written Statement
    Guidelines, p. 27).

Once all deadlines have passed to submit materials, the Office of
Student Conduct may review all documents to ensure that they follow the
process’ established policies and procedures. The Office of Student
Conduct will compile the Report, written responses, and any other
materials into the official Case File (“Case File”).

The inclusion of any materials into the Case File is at the discretion
of the Office of Student Conduct. The Office of Student Conduct may
remove and/or redact any materials that they deem necessary to ensure a
fair and equitable process, such as, but not limited to: character
assessments, prejudicial testimony, irrelevant evidence, and/or
duplicative information.

In rare circumstances, where there is no evidence in the Report to
support the allegations in the Complaint, the Office of Student Conduct
may determine not to move the case forward to a Hearing.

Hearing

A Sexual Misconduct Hearing Panel (“Hearing Panel”) will be assembled to
review the Case File, conduct a Hearing, and determine if the Respondent
violated a policy of the Code of Student Conduct (see also: Hearing
Panels, p. 21). In cases that involve allegations of sexual misconduct,
the Hearing Panel will determine if a violation occurred based on the
applicable standard of proof and the information submitted to the
Hearing Panel.

1.  For all allegations of behaviors included under the policy
    definition of Sexual Misconduct, the Hearing Panel will use a
    standard of “More Likely than Not” to determine if a violation
    occurred.
2.  For allegations of on-campus behaviors not included under the policy
    definition of Sexual Misconduct, the Hearing Panel will use a
    standard of “Clear and Convincing” to determine if a violation
    occurred.
3.  For allegations of off-campus behaviors not included under the
    policy definition of Sexual Misconduct, the Hearing Panel will use a
    standard of “More Likely than Not” to determine if a violation
    occurred.

The Complainant and Respondent will be notified of the time and place of
the Hearing at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the Hearing.

The Office of Student Conduct will provide access to the Case File for
the Hearing Panel, Complainant, and Respondent at least two (2) calendar
days prior to the Hearing.

1.  Any hard copies of the Case File must be returned to the Hearing
    Judicial Coordinator for Student Conduct at the conclusion of the
    Hearing.
2.  If a digital copy of the Case File is made available to the parties,
    the parties will lose access to the digital copy at the conclusion
    of the Hearing.
3.  Complainants and Respondents are not permitted to share the Case
    File with any individual(s) other than their advisor and/or
    parent/guardian(s), provided the parent/guardian(s) is not serving
    as a witness (see also: Advisor/Support Person, p. 24).

During the Hearing, the Hearing Panel will conduct separate interviews
with the Complainant and Respondent regarding the information in the
Case File (see also: Hearing Agenda, p. 30).

1.  The Complainant and Respondent may not be present in the Hearing
    room at the same time. However, each party may listen to and/or
    watch the other individual’s interview from another room via audio
    and/or visual technology.
2.  In the event of technical difficulties, the Office of Student
    Conduct will make appropriate adjustments to ensure a prompt,
    thorough, and equitable hearing. These reasonable adjustments may
    include, but would not be limited to, having the parties in the same
    room and using a physical barrier to separate and limit interaction
    between the parties.

It is expected that the Hearing Panel will rely on the Case File and
interviews with the Complainant and Respondent for its determination of
the relevant facts of the case. However, at its discretion, the Hearing
Panel may request, in advance of the Hearing, additional information or
witnesses referenced in the Case File to be presented at the Hearing.

A finding of responsibility must be determined by a majority vote of the
Hearing Panel.

Sanctioning

If the Hearing Panel finds the Respondent “Responsible,” the Hearing
Panel will impose sanctions. The Hearing Panel will receive access to
each party’s Impact Statement and the information regarding any prior
Code of Student Conduct violations by the Respondent, if applicable, to
review while deliberating sanctions.

Due to the serious nature of a sexual misconduct violation, a Hearing
Panel will first consider if the Respondent should be removed from the
University community to protect the Complainant and/or the common good
of University community. There are no minimum sanctions that must be
assigned to a Respondent; however, sanctions may likely include
Disciplinary Suspension or Dismissal (see also: University Sanctioning
Guidelines).

In considering the appropriate sanction(s), the Hearing Panel may take
into account several factors, including but not limited to:

1.  Nature of the violation;
2.  University Sanctioning Guidelines;
3.  Respondent’s conduct history;
4.  Impact Statements by the Complainant and Respondent; and/or
5.  Any other aggravating, mitigating, or relevant factors.

Any sanction(s) must be decided by a majority vote of the Hearing Panel.

Notice of Outcome and Letter of Explanation

Every reasonable effort will be made for the Hearing Panel to reach its
decision within one (1) business day after the Hearing. However, a
failure to announce a decision within that time period does not
constitute grounds for appeal.

After the Hearing Panel reaches its decision, the Judicial Hearing
Coordinator will compile two documents detailing the outcome of the
complaint:

1.  Notice of Outcome
2.  Letter of Explanation

Notice of Outcome

Approximately one (1) business day after the Hearing Panel’s decision,
the Hearing Judicial Coordinator and/or Director for Student Conduct
will disclose, in writing, the Notice of Outcome to the Respondent and
Complainant at approximately the same time.

The Notice of Outcome for the Respondent may include, but is not limited
to:

1.  The Hearing Panel’s findings for each alleged violation;
2.  Sanction(s);
3.  Protective Measures and/or additional remedies that directly relate
    to the Respondent; and
4.  Appeal rights.

The Notice of Outcome for the Complainant may include, but is not
limited to:

1.  The Hearing Panel’s findings for each alleged violation;
2.  Sanction(s) imposed on the Respondent that directly relate to the
    Complainant;
3.  Protective Measures and/or additional remedies offered or provided
    to the Complainant (see also: Protective Measures and Remedies, p.
    23);
4.  Other steps the University has taken to eliminate any hostile
    environment, if the University finds one to exist, and prevent the
    recurrence of misconduct (see also: Protective Measures and
    Remedies, p. 23); and
5.  Appeal rights.

Letter of Explanation

1.  Within 10 business days of distributing the Notice of Outcome to
    both parties, the Hearing Judicial Coordinator for Student Conduct
    and/or Director for Student

Appealing a Decision

Overview

The outcome of a formal complaint may be appealed by the Complainant
and/or Respondent by submitting a Statement of Appeal to the Office of
Student Conduct. A Complainant and/or Respondent who submits a Statement
of Appeal is called an “Appellant.”

An Appellant must submit their Statement of Appeal within seven (7)
calendar days of the date on their Letter of Explanation. An Appellant
may not submit more than 20 pages of materials in support of their
Appeal (see also: Written Statement Guidelines, p. 27).

1.  A Complainant and/or Respondent may request to review the original
    Case File while they prepare a Statement of Appeal. The Complainant
    and/or Respondent must return any hard copies of the Case File to
    the Office of Student Conduct upon submission of an Appeal. If a
    digital copy of the Case File is made available to the Complainant
    and/or Respondent, they will lose access to the digital copy upon
    submission of an Appeal.

Complainants and/or Respondents may appeal on the following grounds in
cases involving sexual misconduct:

1.  Substantial Procedural Error: A specified procedural error or error
    in interpretation of University regulations may have substantially
    affected the process, such that the Complainant and/or Respondent
    was denied a fair process.
2.  New Information of a Substantive Nature: New, significant or
    relevant information becomes available that could not have been
    discovered by a properly diligent Investigator at the time of the
    original decision and that may have substantially affected and/or
    changed the decision of the Hearing Panel.
3.  Substantial Disproportionate Sanction: The sanction appears to be
    substantially disproportionately lenient and/or severe based on the
    facts of the case, as determined by the Hearing Panel.

After a Statement of Appeal has been submitted by a Complainant and/or
Respondent, the Office of Student Conduct will review the document to
ensure that it follows the process’ established policies and procedures.
After review, the Office of Student Conduct will allow the Complainant
and/or Respondent access to the other party’s Statement of Appeal, in
addition to any other information that the Office of Student Conduct
deems relevant to the Appeal.

Each party may submit to the Office of Student Conduct a written
response to the other party’s Statement of Appeal within two (2)
calendar days of receiving access to the Statement of Appeal. The
response must respond to the specific ground(s) for appeal raised in the
other party’s Statement of Appeal. The response may not include more
than 10 pages of materials. The Director for Student Conduct will allow
the other party to review the response (see also: Written Statement
Guidelines, p. 27).

1.  The Complainant and/or Respondent must return any hard copies of the
    other party’s Statement of Appeal to the Office of Student Conduct
    upon their deadline to submit a written response. If a digital copy
    of the other party’s Statement of Appeal is made available to the
    Complainant and/or Respondent, they will lose access to the digital
    copy upon their deadline to submit a written response.

Once all deadlines have passed to submit materials, the Office of
Student Conduct will review all materials to ensure that they follow the
process’ established policies and procedures. The Office of Student
Conduct will compile the Statement of Appeal and any other materials
(e.g. the original Case File, the other party’s written response) into
the official Appeal Case File. The inclusion of any materials into the
Appeal Case File is at the discretion of the Director for Student
Conduct.

The burden of proof rests on the Appellant to establish that the
original decision by the Hearing Panel was flawed by a “clear and
convincing” standard of proof.

The Appeals Committee will review the Appeal Case File and make a
decision (see also: Appeals Committee, p. 23). Appeals will not consist
of any live testimony or interviews.

Appeals Committee Outcome

The following actions may be taken by the Appeals Committee:

1.  Affirm the finding of “Responsibility” and the original sanctions;
2.  Affirm the finding of “Responsibility” and alter the original
    sanctions; or
3.  Overturn the initial findings and sanctions and return the matter to
    the Office of Student Conduct for action consistent with the Appeals
    Committee’s determination.

Any decision must be determined by a majority vote of the Appeals
Committee.

Notice of Appeal Outcome

The Chair of the Appeals Committee will be responsible for compiling the
Notice of Appeal Outcome.

The Chair of the Appeals Committee and/or the Director for Student
Conduct will disclose, in writing, the Notice of Appeal Outcome to the
Appellant and the other party at approximately the same time.

Every reasonable effort will be made to issue the Notice of Appeal
Outcome within 15 business days of the deadline for submission of the
Statement of Appeal.

The Notice of Appeal Outcome may include, but is not limited to:

1.  Findings for each ground on which the Appellant appealed;
2.  Any alterations to sanction(s) that impact the respective party;
3.  Appeals Committee’s rationale for its decision; and
4.  Information if the case was referred back to the Office of Student
    Conduct.

The Appeals Committee’s decision is final and binding on all parties.

<div id="sexualmisconducthearingandappealscommittee">

## VIII. Sexual Misconduct Hearing and Appeals Committee

Pool of Candidates

1.  The Office of Student Conduct will maintain a Sexual Misconduct
    Panel pool of students and faculty/staff members to resolve
    incidents that include allegations of sexual misconduct. In addition
    to being trained in the policies and procedures of the Georgetown
    University student conduct system, these members will receive annual
    training on, among other things, the University’s policies and
    procedures, how to conduct a fair and equitable adjudication, and
    the effects of trauma on parties impacted by sexual misconduct.

Hearing Panels

A Sexual Misconduct Hearing Panel will be assembled from the available
pool of candidates and may comprise two (2) faculty/staff members and
one (1) student to hear a case involving allegations of sexual
misconduct.

1.  To ensure a student perspective is taken into account during the
    adjudication of the case, the Office of Student Conduct will
    typically assign a currently enrolled student to a Hearing Panel.
    However, in certain circumstances, the Office of Student Conduct may
    assign a recently graduated student, if they graduated within one
    semester prior to the Hearing.
2.  Typically, an undergraduate student will be assigned to the Hearing
    Panel if the allegations are against an undergraduate student.
3.  Typically, a graduate student will be assigned to the Hearing Panel
    if the allegations are against a graduate student.

At the written request of both the Complainant and Respondent, the
Office of Student Conduct will substitute a faculty/staff member in
place of the one (1) student member of the panel for Sexual Misconduct
cases. If this request is not submitted, in writing, by both the
Complainant and Respondent, the Hearing Panel will remain two (2)
faculty/staff members and one (1) student.

The Director for Student Conduct will appoint a Chair of the Hearing
Panel. The Chair of the Hearing Panel must be a faculty or staff member.
The Chair of the Hearing Panel is charged with the responsibility for
ensuring the orderly administration of the Hearing interviews and
deliberations.

The Hearing Judicial Coordinator will attend the Hearing and
deliberations. The Hearing Judicial Coordinator will not vote on any
decision, but will work with the Chair of the Hearing Panel to ensure
that these procedures are conducted in an efficient and orderly fashion.
The Hearing Judicial Coordinator may interject in cases of clear
procedural error, as well as answer questions of the Hearing Panel
regarding procedures.

The Director for Student Conduct may request University legal counsel to
be present at the Hearing and during deliberations. Legal counsel will
not vote on any decisions.

Appeals Committee

The Appeals Committee is a standing committee of the Office of the Vice
President for Student Affairs. The Appeals Committee will consist of:

1.  Senior Administrator from Student Affairs
2.  Faculty/staff representative; and
3.  Student representative.

Appeals Committee members are not permitted to hear appeals for cases if
they served as a voting member on the original Hearing Panel
adjudicating the case.

The Director for Student Conduct may appoint a non-voting Chair of the
Appeals Committee, typically the Hearing Judicial Coordinator for
Student Conduct, to assure that University procedures are followed
throughout the appeal process.

The Director for Student Conduct may request University legal counsel to
be present at Appeals Committee deliberations. Legal counsel will not
vote on any decisions.

</div>

<div id="protectivemeasuresandremedies">

## IX. Protective Measures and Remedies

The University is committed to preventing the recurrence of any sexual
misconduct and correcting its discriminatory effects on the Complainant
and University community.

A Hearing Panel, the Title IX Coordinator, Deputy Title IX
Coordinator(s), and/or the Director for Student Conduct may determine
that Protective Measures and/or additional remedies are necessary and
appropriate in order to eliminate a hostile environment, prevent the
recurrence of sexual misconduct, and, as appropriate, remedy the effects
of sexual misconduct. To ensure equal access to the University’s
educational programs and activities for all students, Protective
Measures and/or additional remedies may be implemented before, during,
and after the processing of a student conduct complaint.

Since these measures are meant to protect and support all parties
involved in the student conduct process and the University community,
they may not be considered sanctions and may be implemented regardless
of a finding of responsibility.

The Director for Student Conduct may determine the most appropriate
Protective Measures and/or remedies to implement for each specific
incident. The Director for Student Conduct may also refer individuals to
other offices at the University to discuss Protective Measures and/or
remedies outside the purview of the Office of Student Conduct.

Protective Measures and/or remedies for individual students may include,
but are not limited to:

1.  No-contact orders;
2.  Temporary housing and dining changes;
3.  Employment and/or co-curricular accommodations;
4.  Temporary course changes;
5.  Medical and counseling services;
6.  Academic support services and accommodations; and
7.  Additional training and education for students.

Remedies for the entire University community may include, but are not
limited to:

1.  Training or retraining employees on the University’s
    responsibilities to address allegations of sexual misconduct;
2.  Developing materials on sexual misconduct, which could be
    distributed to University community members; and/or
3.  Conducting bystander intervention and sexual misconduct prevention
    programs.

</div>

<div id="advisorsupportperson">

## X. Advisor/Support Person

1.  Each Complainant and Respondent may be accompanied by one advisor of
    their choosing during all aspects of their case preparation up to
    and throughout the hearing proceedings. The advisor is not an
    advocate, but rather a source of personal and moral support to the
    student.
2.  An advisor may not be a witness, speak, or otherwise participate on
    behalf of the student. All information concerning all aspects of the
    case will be communicated by the Office of Student Conduct directly
    to the student. Timelines and/or deadlines for submission of
    materials may not be altered to accommodate an advisor’s schedule.

</div>

<div id="prohibitedTestimonypriorSexualHistoryAndDress">

## XI. Prohibited Testimony, Prior Sexual History, and Dress

Prohibited Evidence and Testimony

1.  Evidence and testimony provided by any party during the student
    conduct process should be limited to first-hand factual or
    circumstantial knowledge of the matter. The Director for Student
    Conduct may remove and/or redact any evidence that he/she/they deem
    necessary to ensure a fair and equitable process, such as, but not
    limited to: character assessments, prejudicial testimony, irrelevant
    evidence, and/or duplicative information. Additionally, information
    from either a privately hired investigator and/or polygraph
    examination is not permitted.

Prior Sexual History and Dress

1.  Information regarding either the Complainant’s or Respondent’s prior
    sexual history with other persons may not be included in the
    Investigative Report and/or discussed during the Hearing, unless a
    party makes a specific claim about their own prior sexual history.
    Please see the interpretive guidance in Section VI. C. 3. for
    detailed guidance regarding this policy’s definition of Consent as
    it relates to past consent to a sexual act or sexual contact.
2.  The style of dress of either the Complainant or Respondent may not
    be considered in reference to either party giving consent for an
    alleged act.

</div>

<div id="amnestyForAlcoholAndDrugUse">

## XII. Amnesty for Alcohol and Drug Use

In cases of alleged sexual misconduct, Code of Student Conduct charges
will not be brought against a Complainant, Respondent, or a
participating witness, related to their own consumption of alcohol
and/or personal use of illegal or counterfeit drugs or controlled
substance.

</div>

<div id="NonRetaliation">

## XIII. Non-Retaliation

It is illegal and contrary to University policy for any individual to
engage, whether directly or indirectly, in retaliatory conduct directed
against a person who files a sexual misconduct complaint or gives
testimony during an investigation of such a complaint.

As used in the above paragraph, “retaliatory conduct” means conduct that
adversely and unjustifiably affects another’s terms and conditions of
employment, educational experience, or quality of life, and that is
motivated by an intent to cause harm because of the targeted
individual’s involvement in the filing or investigation of a sexual
misconduct complaint. Any individual who believes that retaliatory
actions have been taken against him or her for having filed a complaint
or provided testimony in an investigation of sexual misconduct is
encouraged to contact the Director for Student Conduct immediately.

</div>

<div id="TimeframeForResolution">

## XIV. Timeframe for Resolution

1.  Georgetown University strives to resolve complaints involving
    allegations of sexual misconduct as promptly as possible after
    receipt of a complaint.
2.  The following table offers general guidelines as to the length of
    each step in the Office of Student Conduct’s sexual misconduct
    process. Since each case has its own unique complexities, the
    following time frames are not rigid requirements. Depending on the
    circumstances of the case, these guidelines may need to be adjusted
    to appropriately balance promptness with the principles of
    thoroughness and fundamental fairness throughout the student conduct
    process.

</div>

<div id="RequestsforAnonymityandorNonPursuitofaComplaint">

## XV. Requests for Anonymity and/or Non-Pursuit of a Complaint

The University will strive to accommodate a Complainant’s wishes to
remain anonymous and/or to not pursue a formal complaint for incidents
involving allegations of sexual misconduct.

1.  When considering whether they wish to remain anonymous and/or to not
    pursue a formal complaint, Complainants are advised that the
    University’s ability to respond to the alleged behavior may be
    limited if the Complainant chooses not to participate in the
    process. Additionally, Complainants are advised that the University
    strictly forbids retaliatory conduct against students who choose to
    file a complaint and/or participate in an investigation of sexual
    misconduct (see also: Non-Retaliation, p. 25).

If the Complainant wishes to remain anonymous and/or not pursue a formal
complaint, they may submit a written request to the Office of Student
Conduct. Consistent with the University’s commitment to provide a
reasonably safe and non-discriminatory environment for all students, the
Director for Student Conduct may be unable to honor a Complainant’s
request and may pursue a case with the University serving as the
Complainant. When weighing a Complainant’s request, the Director for
Student Conduct may consult with numerous campus partners (e.g. Deputy
Title IX Coordinator(s), Threat Assessment, Student Health Services,
GUPD, and/or Office of the General Counsel) to consider a range of
factors including, but not limited to:

1.  circumstances that suggest that the Respondent may likely commit
    additional acts of sexual misconduct;
2.  circumstances that suggest there is an increased risk of future acts
    of sexual misconduct under similar circumstances;
3.  whether the sexual misconduct was perpetrated with a weapon; and
4.  whether the University possesses other means to obtain relevant
    evidence.

In cases where the Director for Student Conduct is able to honor the
Complainant’s request and does not pursue a complaint against the
Respondent, the Office of Student Conduct may still retain information
regarding the incident. This information may be reintroduced into a
future complaint against the Respondent.

</div>

<div id="Confidentiality">

## XVI. Confidentiality

1.  Due to the sensitive nature of grievances, in order to facilitate
    open and honest testimony, all information presented during a
    student conduct proceeding is confidential and may not be disclosed
    to the public. Specifically, the testimony, whether written or oral,
    presented by the Respondent, Complainant, or witnesses during the
    conduct proceedings and all documents provided in preparation for or
    during the conduct proceeding may not be disclosed to any other
    party, except for one’s Advisor.
2.  The Office of Student Conduct will preserve the confidentiality of
    information provided in connection with a complaint to the extent
    possible, consistent with the Code of Student Conduct’s Record
    Retention Policy and the goals of a prompt, thorough, and equitable
    process. All publicly available records required to be maintained by
    law will omit the names and other personally identifiable
    information about Complainants and other alleged victims who choose
    not to file a formal complaint, to the extent permissible by law.

</div>

<div id="WrittenStatementGuidelines">

## XVII. Written Statement Guidelines

All written materials (e.g. Statements of Complaint, Statements of
Response, Impact Statements, Statements of Appeal) submitted to the
Investigator and/or Office of Student Conduct should be typed with an
easily legible font on standard-sized paper (8.5” x 11”) with 1” margins
on all sides. The Office of Student Conduct recommends Calibri or Times
New Roman in a 12-point font size. Written materials must be in the
individual’s own words and may not be authored by advisors, including
attorneys.

</div>

<div id="AudioRecordings">

## XVIII. Audio Recordings

Hearings may be recorded by the Office of Student Conduct. No other
recording of the Hearing is permitted. The recording may be used in
deliberations by the Hearing Panel and/or by the Appeals Committee.

No other recording or use of any technology during student conduct
meetings and/or interviews is permitted by the Complainant, Respondent,
witnesses, and/or advisors.

If a Complainant and/or Respondent decides to appeal a Hearing Panel
decision and wishes to access the Hearing recording, a request for
access to the recording must be submitted within two (2) calendar days
from the date of the Hearing Panel’s Letter of Explanation.

1.  The Appellant’s Statement of Appeal must be submitted within seven
    (7) calendar days from the date in which the Appellant received
    access to the Hearing recording.
2.  If copies of the recording are made available to the Appellant, it
    is the responsibility of the Appellant to cover any costs and/or
    supply materials needed to copy the recording. Copying or attempting
    to copy the recording without the permission of the Office of
    Student Conduct is prohibited. The recording and all copies of the
    recording must be returned to the Office of Student Conduct upon the
    deadline to submit the Appeal..
3.  If a digital file of the recording is made available to the
    Appellant, the Appellant will lose access to the recording upon the
    deadline to submit the Appeal. Copying or attempting to copy a
    digital copy of the recording without the permission of the Office
    of Student Conduct is prohibited.

</div>

<div id="ProceduralAlterations">

## XIX. Procedural Alterations

The Office of Student Conduct is committed to providing a prompt,
thorough, and equitable investigation and resolution of complaints
involving allegations of sexual misconduct. As such, the Director for
Student Conduct may make reasonable alterations to any of these
procedures in the spirit of providing a prompt, thorough, and equitable
process for all parties involved in the student conduct process.

</div>

<div id="AccommodationStatement">

## XX. Accommodation Statement

Georgetown University is committed to ensuring an inclusive and
equitable environment for individuals with disabilities. If you have a
medical condition or disability and believe you may require a reasonable
accommodation in order to participate in any part of the student conduct
process, please notify the Office of Student Conduct and submit your
written request to Dr. Jane Holahan, Director of the Academic Resource
